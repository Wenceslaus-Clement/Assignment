SYSTEM PATHS

What are System paths?

Paths are system variables that the operating system uses to find & pinpoint need executables (ike files, applications) from the command line interface or terminal window.

For instance, C:\Chryswenort Networks\home\Nice\text.txt. This implies that from the local disk to a folder named "Chryswenort Networks" and then to a folder called "home", then

to another folder "Nice" and then to the text.txt file contained in it.

They are also lists of directories or a chain showing the exact location of executable files in the system.
